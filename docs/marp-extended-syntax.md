# Marp Extended syntax

Marp Extended uses standard [Marpit Markdown](https://marpit.marp.app/markdown)
and [Marp Core Markdown](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/blob/main/docs/markdown.md)
as its base language. The plugin adds a small `%%marp-*%%` authoring layer for
layout and semantic wrappers that are awkward to write as raw HTML in Obsidian.

## What is standard and what is Extended

Use standard Marp/Marpit syntax wherever it already exists:

| Need | Syntax owner | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slides | Marpit | `---` ruler between slides |
| Global/local directives | Marpit | `paginate: true`, `<!-- _class: lead -->` |
| Backgrounds and image sizing | Marpit | `![bg right:40%](image.png)`, `![w:400](image.png)` |
| Fragmented lists | Marpit + preview host | `* item` or `1) item` |
| Presenter notes | Marpit + preview host | ordinary `<!-- comment -->` |
| Scoped styles | Marpit | `<style scoped>...</style>` |
| Fitting headings, emoji, math, code | Marp Core | `# <!-- fit --> Title`, `$E=mc^2$`, fenced code |
| Obsidian image embeds | Marp Extended adapter | `![[image.png\|600]]` |
| Columns, cards, semantic callouts | Marp Extended language | `%%marp-columns%%`, `%%marp-cards[...]%%` |
| Mermaid figures | Marp Extended adapter | fenced `mermaid` block |

Marp Extended does not add alternative syntax for slide separators,
backgrounds, fragments, or presenter notes.

## Deck frontmatter

Deck-wide configuration remains normal Marp frontmatter:

```yaml
---
marp: true
theme: kami
lang: en
mermaidTheme: kami
mermaidFlat: true
size: kami
paginate: true
footer: "Kami · Marp Extended"
---
```

`theme`, `size`, `paginate`, `header`, `footer`, and other Marp directives retain
their upstream meaning. `mermaidTheme` and `mermaidFlat` are plugin additions.

## Slide-local directives

`%%marp-slide[...]%%` is an Obsidian-friendly shorthand for Marpit spot
directives:

```md
%%marp-slide[class=cover paginate=false footer="" header="01 · Origin"]%%
```

It compiles to:

```md
<!-- _class: cover -->
<!-- _paginate: false -->
<!-- _footer: "" -->
<!-- _header: 01 · Origin -->
```

Put the marker on the slide it controls. Quote values containing spaces. Use
standard directive comments directly when the shorthand is not useful.

## Semantic blocks

All blocks use paired Obsidian comment markers. Their contents remain normal
Markdown and can contain headings, lists, code fences, Mermaid fences, or nested
Extended blocks.

| Marker | Stable output class |
| --- | --- |
| `marp-lead` | `marp-extended-lead` |
| `marp-subtitle` | `marp-extended-subtitle` |
| `marp-metadata` | `marp-extended-metadata` |
| `marp-callout[variant=co]` | `marp-extended-callout marp-extended-callout-co` |
| `marp-callout[variant=mc]` | `marp-extended-callout marp-extended-callout-mc` |
| `marp-callout[variant=note]` | `marp-extended-callout marp-extended-callout-note` |

Example:

```md
%%marp-lead%%
Same Markdown, with a reusable semantic wrapper.
%%/marp-lead%%

%%marp-callout[variant=warning]%%
The variant becomes `marp-extended-callout-warning`.
%%/marp-callout%%
```

Callout variants are normalized to lowercase CSS-safe tokens. The only callout
attribute is `variant`; omitting it selects `co`. Variants are theme hooks:
the Kami theme styles `mc` as a secondary note and `co` / `note` as conclusion
callouts.

A callout with `variant=note` is visible slide content, not a presenter note. Use
a standard Marpit HTML comment for presenter notes.

## Columns

Use `%%marp-columns%%` and split columns with `%%marp-column%%`:

````md
%%marp-columns%%
### Standard Marpit

* Fragmented item
* Another item

%%marp-column%%

### Extended layout

```mermaid[Render path]
flowchart LR
  M[Markdown] --> C[Compiler] --> R[Marp Core]
```
%%/marp-columns%%
````

One through six columns receive
`marp-extended-columns-1` … `marp-extended-columns-6`. Each child receives
`marp-extended-column`.

## Cards

Use `columns=N` (1–6) to choose cards per row and split cards with
`%%marp-card%%`:

```md
%%marp-cards[columns=2]%%
### A · Palette
One accent.

%%marp-card%%

### B · Type
One serif.

%%marp-card%%

### C · Layout
Namespaced structural classes.

%%marp-card%%

### D · Runtime
Shared Core 5 semantics.
%%/marp-cards%%
```

The first heading in each card becomes `marp-extended-card-title`. `A · Palette`,
`A: Palette`, and `A：Palette` split the leading label into
`marp-extended-card-label`. `columns` is the only cards attribute; values from 1
through 6 are supported.

## Editor commands

The command palette exposes one insertion command for each canonical form:

- **Insert Marp Extended slide metadata**
- **Insert Marp Extended lead block**
- **Insert Marp Extended subtitle block**
- **Insert Marp Extended metadata block**
- **Insert Marp Extended callout block**
- **Insert Marp Extended columns block**
- **Insert Marp Extended 2x2 cards block**

## Fragments and presenter notes in preview

Marpit marks unordered lists using `*` and ordered lists using `1)` as
fragments:

```md
* First reveal
* Second reveal

1) First ordered reveal
2) Second ordered reveal
```

The Marp Extended preview adds the runtime behavior that Marpit intentionally
leaves to its host application. Use the command palette or bind these commands:

- **Next preview fragment**
- **Previous preview fragment**
- **Reset preview fragments**
- **Toggle preview presenter notes**

An ordinary comment becomes a presenter note for its slide:

```md
# Public slide

<!--
Private presenter note. This is shown as text in the preview notes panel.
-->
```

Directive comments such as `<!-- _class: lead -->` are directives, not notes.
The notes panel renders comments as literal text rather than injected HTML.

## Fences, nesting, and malformed markers

The compiler recognizes CommonMark backtick and tilde fences, including long and
up-to-three-space-indented fences. Marker-looking text inside a fence is left
literal. Nested Extended blocks are compiled recursively.

Ordinary Obsidian comments such as `%%draft note%%` are unchanged. Unknown,
unclosed, or mismatched Extended markers are also left in the source rather than
silently consuming following content.

## Preview/export runtime contract

Preview and managed export use the same Marp Core 5 engine factory, HTML policy,
inline SVG mode, Shiki subset, MathJax integration, Mermaid fallback, CSS
minification, and Extended structural CSS. Each render receives a fresh engine
instance.

The hosts still own different outer behavior: preview uses an Obsidian iframe,
while Marp CLI owns the HTML template and the browser-backed PDF/PPTX pipeline.
This is semantic parity, not a pixel-for-pixel guarantee across browsers and file
formats.

Managed export requires Marp CLI **4.5.0** and passes the shipped Core 5 engine
through `--engine`. Auto-detected incompatible versions can use the pinned
`@marp-team/marp-cli@4.5.0` npx fallback when enabled. An explicitly configured
incompatible executable fails with a version error instead of silently using a
different rendering contract.

Release/manual installs use `marp-engine.cjs` directly when its hash matches.
Community installs and upgrades materialize a content-addressed engine filename
from the copy embedded in `main.js`, which avoids unsafe in-place replacement on
Windows and lets concurrent exports accept the same verified artifact.

## HTML and trust boundary

HTML is always enabled because Extended layout wrappers and pre-rendered Mermaid
SVG require it. There is no separate “Enable HTML” setting.

Treat decks and themes as trusted author content:

- the Obsidian preview runs in a sandboxed iframe without script permission;
- raw HTML follows standard Marpit HTML handling;
- exported HTML follows Marp CLI's `--html` behavior and may execute
  author-supplied HTML scripts when opened in a browser.

Do not preview or export untrusted Markdown as active HTML without reviewing it.
